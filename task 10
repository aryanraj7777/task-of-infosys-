Task 10: Handling of special cases and edge scenarios for better user experience

To handle special cases and edge scenarios for better user experience, we can implement the following:

Handle invalid user IDs: In the verify_user_by_id method, we can add a check to handle invalid user IDs. If the user ID is invalid, we can return a 404 response with an error message.

Handle duplicate verification requests: We can add a check to ensure that a user is not verified multiple times. If a user is already verified, we can return a response indicating that the user is already verified.
Handle errors during verification: We can add try-except blocks to handle any errors that may occur during the verification process. If an error occurs, we can return a response with an error message.

# employers/views.py
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet
from.models import Employer
from.serializers import EmployerSerializer
from users.models import User

class EmployersViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Employer.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployerSerializer

    #... (other methods)

    def verify_user_by_id(self, request, pk):
        try:
            user = User.objects.get(pk=pk)
            if user.is_verified:
                return Response({'message': 'User is already verified'})
            user.is_verified = True
            user.save()
            return Response({'message': 'User verified successfully'})
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return Response({'message': 'User not found'}, status=404)
        except Exception as e:
            return Response({'message': 'Error verifying user: {}'.format(str(e))}, status=500)
