Task 9: Verify-Users-By-Id API implementation in Employers Viewset

To implement the verify-users-by-id API in the Employers Viewset, we can add a new method to the EmployersViewSet class.

# employers/views.py
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet
from.models import Employer
from.serializers import EmployerSerializer
from users.models import User

class EmployersViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Employer.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployerSerializer

    #... (other methods)

    def verify_user_by_id(self, request, pk):
        user = User.objects.get(pk=pk)
        if user:
            user.is_verified = True
            user.save()
            return Response({'message': 'User verified successfully'})
        return Response({'message': 'User not found'}, status=404)

In the above code, we've added a new method verify_user_by_id to the EmployersViewSet class. This method takes a pk parameter, which is the ID of the user to be verified. It fetches the user instance using the User model, sets the is_verified field to True, and saves the changes. If the user is found, it returns a success response with a message. If the user is not found, it returns a 404 response with an error message.
